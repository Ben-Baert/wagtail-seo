Customizing SEO Metadata
========================

Turning Features On or Off
--------------------------

The recommended way to turn features on or off is using the Wagtail Site
Settings. From the Wagtail Admin select **Settings** > **SEO**. From here each
type of metadata can be turned on or off.

.. note::

    In order for Twitter cards to work correctly, a twitter account must be
    specified. This is the "@username" of the site owner's Twitter account.
    Most likely this would be a brand account.


Specifying Metadata (for Editors)
---------------------------------

While editing the page, special SEO metadata can be specified under the
**Promote** tab.

* **SEO Title** --- If specified, this title will show up in the browser tab,
  in search engine results, and on social media previews exactly as-is. If
  empty, the page's normal title will be used, appended with the Site name (from
  **Settings** > **Sites** > **Site name**) as so: "Page Title - Site Name"

* **Search Description** --- This will show up in search engine results and
  social media previews.
